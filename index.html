              <div class="sub-text2">
                Huge, one of the largest gardens in the world. It is located near Cape Town, near Table Mountain. The
                diverse flora here is represented by 7,000 species.
                The founder of the garden, long before the official opening date, was Cecil Rhodes, at the beginning of
                the 19th century. The white businessman, diamond merchant and politician who bought the Cape Colony
                organized the planting of trees,
                including oaks, fig trees and camphor trees, creating alleys under them. Harold Pearson continued his
                work, complementing the green ensemble with the construction of the University of Cape Town. In addition,
                it was decided to significantly expand the diversity of plant species, clearing the space of weeds and
                creating many pedestrian alleys.
                This was facilitated by the landscape and picturesque area of ​​Mount Table. The official date of
                foundation of the magnificent botanical garden was 1913.

                The Kalahari Desert is located in a depression with the same name, with an area of ​​930 thousand km2. Part of
                it
                extends through Namibia and Botswana.
                Iron oxides give the sands of this desert their red, pink, brown, brown tints. The air temperature in the desert
                on a
                summer day is 40 degrees or more. In winter it drops to -15 °C. The Okavango River flows through the Kalahari.
                Its delta
                is inhabited by animals and birds: lions, cheetahs, hyenas, giraffes, zebras, gazelles, in addition to large
                predators
                and ungulates,
                which they hunt, you can find a lot of rodents and birds here.
                In the Kalahari, there are some types of vegetation in relative abundance, including deciduous trees, shrubs,
                and grass
                tussocks.

              <div class="sub-text2">
                The ancient ridges of the Bushman Mountains rise above the land of South Africa, reaching the highest heights of any
                mountain on the mainland. The highest point is 3482 m. The main rock they consist of is basalt. These mountains have
                many ridges, ravines, ledges and caves. In the darkness they look like huge sleeping dragons.
                Hence the name – Drakensberg Mountains.
                From north to south, for 8 km, the ridges stretch, an almost vertical sheer wall, thousands of meters in height. The
                climate of the western slopes differs from the eastern part. The western zones of the mountains are arid, and in the
                east there is a lot of rainfall. In the mountains you can breathe clean air, admire waterfalls, be alone with nature,
                away from civilization.
                These places are rich in many species of plants and wild animals.

                It is also called the kingdom of penguins. It is located within the Table Mountain National Park. This is a
                beautiful
                place, famous for its magnificent views of the sea, large boulders, and of course, penguins.
                History says that this place acquired its charming inhabitants in 1982. Then a couple of these birds came here. They
                really liked it here, because here you can eat sardines and have a good time. Later they were joined by other
                representatives of a large family of birds. Now this colony numbers about 30,000 animals.
                Little climbers and swimmers make themselves at home. And for people there is a bridge from which they can admire the
                white-breasted beauties and the giant rocks and rocks that hide this corner of South Africa from the winds and waves.
                One day there was a shipwreck near the beach and a large oil slick spilled.
                The penguins were caught and transported to a similar place, to the north of the mainland. But the colony soon came back
                in full force.
